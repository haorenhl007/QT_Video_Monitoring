# QT_Video_Monitoring
Source Code for the QT_Video_Monitoring Project.

It is recommended using "Qt Creator(with Qt5 version)" to open and manage this project.

In the "file" folder, there is an executable program "VM", a config file "config.txt" and a database file "VM.db".

You can execute the "VM" program to view the GUI. Since the program was built for a high school and a kindergarten in Shanghai, the language used in the program is Chinese.

If you compile the souce code by yourself, before you run the program, please remember to copy the config file and the database file from the "file" folder to your compiled folder (make sure the "config.txt" and the "VM.db" are in same path with the "VM" executable program).
